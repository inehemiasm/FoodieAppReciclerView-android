    <string name="meal_details_placeholder">It is a long established fact that a reader will
            be distracted by the readable content of a page when
            looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
            that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
            as opposed to using \'Content here, content here\', making it
            look like readable English.
            Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors
            now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
            search for \'lorem ipsum\' will uncover many web sites
            still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
            the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose
            (injected humour and the like).</string>
